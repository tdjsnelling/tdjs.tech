It is a great way to make new friends, or it's perfect if you're bored and just want to chat!

Started as a weekend project when I was learning React. The server maintains a list of connected clients, and whether or not they are free (not currently in a chat). When you join, you will be connected randomly with one of these free users and will be able to start a conversation. When the conversation is over, find a new partner and start chatting with someone new.

Built with React and socket.io. View the source [here](https://github.com/tdjsnelling/yakk).
