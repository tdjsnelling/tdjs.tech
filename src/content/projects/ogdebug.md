When working on a client site, I couldn't find a reliable and convenient way to debug [open graph](http://ogp.me) tags without deploying the site and using something like the Facebook debugging tool.

I built a small tool to produce a Facebook-esque report for a site running locally. The tool can either produce a report in your command line with a list of parsed open graph tags (plus some extras) or a HTML report with a preview of what a link shared on social media might look like.
