Magnetic Media came to us for an informative and eye-catching microsite for their latest campaign, 'Pay Attention'. The main driving force behind the campaign was a desire to not only address but disprove the common perception in media today that magazines are an ineffective form of marketing and therefore unworthy of investment.

I was the sole developer on the Pay Attention site, so I worked closely with the lead designer on this project to achieve the outcome that the client desired.

Clock worked extremely closely with both the Magnetic team and their creative designers to ensure their collective vision was accurately translated on the front-end. The selection of colours meant the curation would require careful consideration to ensure that all content was enhanced, and at the same time, complementary.

The site is simple, fast, and effective. It's primary purpose is to deliver content from their campaign report, which is does excellently. A selection of industry leaders also shared viewpoints relating to the campaign, providing some article-like content for the site.

User flows are deliberately uncomplicated and intuitive, resulting in a platform that is very easy to navigate. Subtle touches gently draw the user towards key information pieces and with seamless integrations of viewpoints and presentation decks, the user’s interest is piqued but their experience is not invaded by bulky call to action buttons.

The site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), an open-source React static site generator known for it's speed. Learning Gatsby was simple and rewarding, and I have used it for plenty of other static sites (including the one you are viewing now) since.
