We produce software relating to current streetwear fashion brands that allow our users to beat the competition to purchasing highly sought-after items, before they are sold out.

We develop and sell successful bots for Supreme New York and Palace Skateboards. With a user base of ~4000 worldwide, we are a trusted and respected provider in the streetwear space.

**Update 2019-03-31**

After a little over 2 years, we have decided to call time on Check Me Out. Building a company from the ground up has been an amazing learning experience, and I have learned skills that I will keep with me forever. However, our interest in the project as lessened over time - we never set out to turn Check Me Out into a business, it was initially only meant to be a tool for us to use personally.

The streetwear space has become _incredibly_ over-saturated in the last 2 years, with a new bot, tool, or monitor of some kind being released every week. We don't believe we can keep up with the trends and demands alongside full-time study, so instead of continuing to sell a potentially inferior tool, we will discontinue trading.

All Check Me Out software is now open source, and available from my [github](https://github.com/tdjsnelling).

Now, on to bigger and better things.
