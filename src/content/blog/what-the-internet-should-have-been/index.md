Your internet self is fragmented - spread across a vast number of proprietary services. Your friends are on Facebook, your conversations are on Slack, your thoughts and writings are on Medium, your photos, notes, contacts are on Google, iCloud etc. The list goes on.

Why can't it just be _yours_?

From the beginning, the internet was meant to be decentralised. It started with ARPANET in 1969, when a node at UCLA sent a message to another node at the Stanford Research Institute. This system, and a few others, evolved and were eventually decommissioned, succeeded by the internet as we know it.

In this early-internet era, there was no central authority. No internet service providers, no online megacorps. Every computer was independent of one another. Then came ISPs, browsers, and the commercialisation of the internet began. Smaller ISPs were quickly muscled out by large players with lots of capital that could provide bundles of telephone and internet usage at lower prices.

Companies like Amazon, Google, and Hotmail emerged and grew quickly. As they grew and we started to rely on them more and more, our data became theirs. Facebook and Twitter were born, and Google is now much more than just a search engine. All of a sudden, all the services we use everyday have become completely centralised.

This is a problem for multiple reasons.

- Can these companies be trusted to keep your data safe? **(No)**
- Can these companies be trusted not to sell your data? **(No)**
- What if a company goes away? What happens to my data, will I just lose access to the service? **(Yes, probably)**
- Can these companies control what I see and do on their platform? **(Absolutely)**

Centralisation can also cause infrastructure problem - just recently, Google Cloud Platform had network issues that caused an outage for the best part of a day. But this wasn't just a problem for Google; numerous other major services (such as Uber, Snapchat, Nest) hosted on the platform also suffered downtime as a result. Had all of these other services been in control of their own infrastructure, the problem would not have spanned beyond Google itself.

This pattern of centralisation has caused services to be _obscured_ by the internet in some regards. Want to show off your holiday photos you took on your phone last year? Sure, you can do so through our 3<sup>rd</sup> party web app that takes 15 seconds to be responsive.
