Peer-to-peer: milton doesn't use any centralised servers. the system is entirely distributed, making it impossible to shut down. everything is stored locally, where it is under your control.

Encrypted: all communications are encrypted with 384-bit ECC. only the intended recipient will ever be able to decrypt your messages.

milton is an experiment and only in early development. Any contribution is welcome.
